1. VPC

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

• VPC is a virtual private cloud, Private cloud itself says everythig
• We Can Create /Configure Our own newtwork
• So that we can deploy our EC2 instance in that private network.
• Can Create own security group to our VPC

Region = Asia Pacific 
Availablity Zone = ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b etc
• Availability Zone = Data center

====================================================================


2. S3 

If website contains data like logo, images, videos etc it must load. We can pull it from S3 Bucket
It load and pull from S3 bucket URL and provides output
	
• Once created S3 bucket we will get url we can use it for website to load video. Ex - hotstar streaming site 

• ACL - Access control list.. Its like Sudo concept..who are all in this list can access to open S3 bucket

	1. Create S3 Bucket
	2. Give permission for bucket
	3. Upload files and give persmission for files

====================================================================

3. EFS 

• EFS is Elastic File System

• EFS is SSD based managed network file system which automatically expand and shrinks based on your amount of data

• Multiple EC2 instance can access the same data via NFS client

• EFS is suitable for large amount of DATA

• EFS is costly than S3

STEPS

1. Create EFS, It will ask for VPC ID, Just give VPC of CloudIq, Or TATA etc depending upon Environment
2. GO inside EFS name created ==> Network => From there get see Security groups ID. [EFS Security Group ID]
3. Now GO to EC2 instance, Just tag/Add EFS Security id. 

Server 1 : Create Directory EG : love [Make sure come out of DIR and mount]

# yum -y install nfs-utils
# sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-1b426263.efs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:/ /home/ec2-user/love

Server 2 : Create Directory EG : marriage [[Make sure come out of DIR and mount]]

# yum -y install nfs-utils
# sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-1b426263.efs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:/ /home/ec2-user/marriage

Result : Now Check whatever ur creating inside Server 1 love directory it will reflect in server 2 marriage directory

sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-1b426263.efs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:/ /home/ec2-user/baby
